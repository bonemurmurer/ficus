FICUS

(excuse the mess left by ongoing construction...)

'ficus' is a nonblocking realtime audio sampler api for linux devs. 
it is written by murray foster, please write at: mrafoster at gmail dawt com

with jack and libsndfile, this software provides simultaneous, multichannel playback/capture of mono wav audio files by way of your harddrive and alsa (also probably faado) compatible audio interface.

i decided to distribute this software as a group of source files because i thought it best that the number of input/output channels, and storage capacity, of each 'ficus' client be available via a header file ('config.h').

please note, this software has been tested via an echo layla24 and cakewalk (roland) ua-25ex.

Dependencies:
libsndfile jack

Installing:
copy the libficus files to your target build directory and build your application like any other included '.c' source file.

cp -r libficus/* yourprogram/.

Building:
gcc -o yourprogram yourprogram.c libficus.c -lsndfile -ljack

Example Usage:
Just add this to your code and see 'libficus.h' for available functions.
(that last integer argument is the bit depth to record all NEW files to)

/* libficus setup */
  if (ficus_setup("yourprogram", "path/to/samples", "testwav", 32) == 1)
   {
     fprintf(stderr, "yourprogram: libficus setup failed.\n");
     return;
   }

TODO (2/10/2013):
*General code refactoring
*Write documentation
*Implement some midi capability (namely, triggered capturing of 'armed' samples)
