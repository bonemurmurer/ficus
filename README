FICUS

(excuse the mess left by ongoing construction...)

'ficus' is a nonblocking realtime audio sampler api for linux devs. 
it is written by murray foster, please write at: mrafoster at gmail dawt com

with jack and libsndfile, this software provides simultaneous, multichannel playback/capture of mono wav audio files by way of your harddrive and alsa (also probably faado) compatible audio interface.

i decided to distribute this software as a group of source files because i thought it best that the number of input/output channels, and storage capacity, of each 'ficus' client be available via a header file ('config.h').

please note, this software has been tested via an echo layla24 and cakewalk (roland) ua-25ex.

Dependencies:
libsndfile jack

Installing:
copy the libficus files to your target build directory and build your application like any other included '.c' source file.

cp -r libficus/* yourprogram/.

Building:
gcc -o yourprogram yourprogram.c libficus.c -lsndfile -ljack

Example Usage:
See the 'examples/' directory.

NEW 
(2013/3/6)
*Fixed reversed playback speed >1.0 flipping playback speed

(2013/3/3)
*New ficus_playback_speed(int bank_number,float speed) function
     speed==0.01-0.99, Slow down sample playback
     speed==1.01+, Increase sample playback
     speed==1, Normal sample playback speed
     speed==-(x), Negative speed represents reversed playback
TODO (2013/3/6):
*General code refactoring
*Write documentation
*Replace the current adjustable playback speed feature with a phase vocoder utilizing the fftw library
*Attack/Delay ramps for sample playback volume (click-eliminator/crossfader)
