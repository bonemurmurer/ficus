FICUS

'ficus' is a realtime sampler API and JACK client for linux.

thru JACK and libsndfile, this api provides simultaneous, multichannel playback/capture 
of audio from/to your hard drive.

i decided to distribute this software as a source file because i thought it best that the 
number of input/output channels, and storage capacity, of each instance of the 'ficus' client 
be available via a header file called 'config.h'.

please note, this software has only been tested via an 8in/8out echo layla24 and
cakewalk (roland) ua-5ex.

Dependencies:
libsndfile jack

Installing:
copy the libficus files to your target build directory and build your application
like any other included '.c' source file.

cp libficus/libficus.c yourprogram/.
cp libficus/libficus.h yourprogram/.
cp libficus/rtqueue.h yourprogram/.
cp libficus/config.h yourprogram/.

gcc -o yourprogram yourprogram.c libficus.c -lsndfile -ljack

Example Usage:
Just add this to your code and see 'libficus.h' for available functions.
(that last integer argument is the bit depth to record all NEW files to)

/* libficus setup */
  if (ficus_setup("yourprogram", "path/to/samples", "testwav", 32) == 1)
   {
     fprintf(stderr, "yourprogram: libficus setup failed.\n");
     return;
   }
